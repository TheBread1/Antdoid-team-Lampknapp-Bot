# Antdoid team's Lampknapp
**It has music, it has basic moderation features, it has reddit browsing, it's fun! It's lampknapp! ~~Sadly it can't be on 24/7~~ (This is pointless now.. now you guys will host it on your own systems!), and I'm still working on it but eventually it may be a viable option as "The Bot that Does It All!"**

**-Please, do NOT manually disconnect Lampknapp from a voice channel, it will break the music player in such a way that it is not fixable on your server until I restart the bot.**


# Technical crap/setup
This script is initially run on Linux Mint as its host. Features like Text-To-Speech(In fact, only text-to-speech!) require the installation of EspeakNG, which can be found at this repository https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/. If you intend on using this open-source project as a template for your own, very exciting robot, be sure you have ffmpeg installed (on PATH or in the same directory as the scripts), discord.py (pip install discord.py), EspeakNG, python 3(or later if this is 5 years old by the time you're viewing this), and youtubedl (pip install youtube-dl). Happy coding!

--SIDE NOTE: The start.sh is REQUIRED for both text to speech **AND** the sound effects to play. Music is unaffected but everything else is. **YOU WILL HAVE TO GO INTO START.SH AND ENTER THE PATH TO THE DIRECTORY THE ROBOT IS IN!**
