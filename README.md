This script is initially run on Linux Mint as its host. Features like Text-To-Speech(In fact, only text-to-speech!) require the installation of EspeakNG, which can be found at this repository https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/. If you intend on using this open-source project as a template for your own, very exciting robot, be sure you have ffmpeg installed (on PATH or in the same directory as the scripts), discord.py (pip install discord.py), EspeakNG, python 3(or later if this is 5 years old by the time you're viewing this), and youtubedl (pip install youtube-dl). Happy coding!
